# Project 3

This project's purpose was a way to implement the introductory of the foundation of the most frequent customers purchasing soda products as this project listed the csv file information of randomized customers and items.
The main focus of the output was:
  Listing the product with a respected name and price of the purchased item.
  The order itself that compacted all of the products that were purchased by the customer.
  Next being the store that had recorded the customer with their orders made, this can vary with how many times a randomized customer were to go to the store.
  And the corporation that had a list of all of the stores within the customers that went to purchase items.

When creating the csv file, which was the goal of the project, it had to be taken into account that a 
randomized time --> storeid --> customerid --> orderid --> name of the product --> and the price of 
product to fully keep track of each random customer that would make a purchase in the store which would
keep record of the purchases for the next project.
